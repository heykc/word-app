# Word App

Small project I made for fun to mess around with SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and Redis (via Upstash). I may or may not eventually make tests for this, but for now it's just a fun little project.

Every day, the game will refresh and post a random definition. The goal is to guess any number of words that matches the definition.
